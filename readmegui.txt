How To Get Playlist URL

Go to the Spotify Webplayer and Navigate to the Playlist you want to download.
Your URL should look something like this:

https://play.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/6RsopNg2yrLjKiu00jaCyi
To download Albums for now the only way to do it is to add the songs to a playlist and then download that playlist.
Paste that in to the Spotify Playlist URL Textbox
